Plasma Sword 2015 Assembly

- Wire power to various circuits
- - 4A 5V connects to the trinket in parrallel with the USB voltage input (unregulated).
- - - Battery snaps into the trinket lipo charger backback
- - - - NeoPixel lights are powered directly by the battery in parallel with the
        large capacitor.
- - - - Sound FX is powered directly by the battery
- - - - Trinket is powered by the lipo charger backback / battery
- - - - - Accelerometer wires into the 3.3 volt regulated output from the
          arduino trinket

- Prepare your arduino ide with the needed libraries.  Use tutorials from
  adafruit.com for help.
- - Adafruit_Soundboard.h
- - Adafruit_NeoPixel.h
- - Adafruit_Sensor.h
- - Adafruit_ADXL345_U.h

- Compile the source code in arduino ide

- Use a usb or FTDI cable to program the trinket

- With the power disconnected, wire the LED to ground and Pin 9. Add a
  resister between the LED and the trinket pin 9.
- - LED -> Trinket Pin 9
- - SW  -> Trinket Pin 4

Notes: DNC = Do not connect
       The switch is not well marked.  You may have to reverse the LED wiring.

- Power up the trinket and make sure that the LED lights up.  Press the button,
  the LED should turn off.

- Power down the circuit and disconnect power.

- Plug the sound effect circuit into your pc by usb cable.  Drag and drop the
  sound files in the following order one at a time.  DO NOT COPY ALL AT ONCE.
  The order copied establishes file numbers used by the sword software.

Troubleshooting: If the order is not followed, you will have to edit the
  software's soundmap arrays to reflect the correct order.

- With the power disconnected, wire up the Sound Effects circuit
- - TX  -> Trinket Pin 3
- - RX  -> Trinket Pin 5
- - RST -> Trinket Pin 8 (optional)

- Power up the circuits and press the button, you should hear the sound effects.

- Power down the circuit and disconnect power.

- With the power disconnected, wire up the Neopixel lights.
- - NEOPIXEL -> Trinket Pin 6

- Power up the circuit and press the button, you should see ALL the lights light up.

- Power down the circuit and disconnect power.

- With the power disconnected, wire up the accelerometer.
- - I2C SDA -> Trinket Pin A4
- - I2C SCL -> Trinket Pin A5

- Power up the circuit and press the button, tap the accelerometer with your
  finger.  You should hear a sound effect.
